There is only one big ‚Äúbut‚Äù - Linux is not supported by Adobe and many other must-have programs. Of course, there is a load of alternatives, but (again) they are not that good as original apps - to be absolutely honest with you - they just suck. Whenever I had to design something or prepare a mockup I was pulling my hair out of my head. So I decided that I have to switch back to windows or mac.\n\tApple computers are quite expensive and for me, they are not worth their price, so as a result, I bought a 13‚Äù windows laptop with a 2K display and 100% sRGB coverage. At this moment I had 2 options - install WSL and use bash (with for me was the perfect option) or stay with Powershell. Firstly I‚Äôve chosen WSL and bash, but after a few days I noticed that this is so uncomfortable and honestly Powershell is enough for my purpose, so I‚Äôve switched back to Powershell.\n\tPowershell on its own is pretty ugly, so the very first thing I did was Windows Terminal installation. Once when I had my new terminal application I started to prettify it.\nFirstly I‚Äôve installed new fonts and setup in my settings.json file. To open the config file press ctrl +, (comma) and also set acrylic opacity to 80%. \n\n![powershel-settings.png](http://kamilpieczyk.tk:1337/uploads/powershel_settings_ba215c87ea.png)\n\nMy next step to make my console pretty was installing oh-my-posh. If you are a bash user you probably know oh-my-zsh for any other people - this is something awesome for Linux/Mac console, something that was not available for windows users for many years. It just makes every bash console rocks ü§òüèª.\n\n![images.jpg](http://kamilpieczyk.tk:1337/uploads/images_425f4c7d8d.jpg)\n> oh my zsh console appearance\n\nNow windows users can have the same or even better with oh-my-posh. There is no need to write here an installation guide because on the project website you can find the best tutorial which will guide you on how to do this in a few very easy steps. just visit [their website](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation). The theme I use is AgnosterPlus. See below how my terminal looks like:\n\n![oh-my-posh.png](http://kamilpieczyk.tk:1337/uploads/oh_my_posh_7aa7b35248.png)\n\n## Let‚Äôs make the VS Code fly to the sky! üöÄ\n\nThanks to Microsoft developers and a huge community VSC is the most customizable code editor on the market. To make VS-Code pretty you don‚Äôt need so much time, most of the changes are very easy to do, everything that you need is to install extensions in most cases. I usually install first some basic extensions to work better with my code like ESLint,  ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets, JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly, GraphQL, Prettier, DOTEnv, Docker, GitHistory, Styled-Components Extractor, EditorConfig for Visual Studio Code, etc.. those extensions are not for prettify your code editor but they are must-have for frontend/backend developer work. \nThe first extension that makes a difference is Vibrancy - this will add a frosted glass transparency effect which is known from macOS or Windows native apps (acrylic blur). But remember, after installation of it your VSC will increase RAM usage.\n\n![screenshot.png](http://kamilpieczyk.tk:1337/uploads/screenshot_dfff487ca2.png)\n> Vibrancy addon\n\nAnother one that I use is vscode-icons-mac. This is a package of icons that appear by folder/filename.\n\n![dark.png](http://kamilpieczyk.tk:1337/uploads/dark_dbd7a97fd4.png)\n> vscode-mac-icons\n\nAnd my last extension is ‚ÄúOperator Mono Dark Theme‚Äù which is my daily use theme. I‚Äôve chosen this one because I also use the Victor Mono font family that is a free and (in my opinion) better replacement for the Operator Mono font family. You can get this font here: \n[https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/)\n\nThe result of all these extensions and font looks like on the picture below: \n\n![my vs code.png](http://kamilpieczyk.tk:1337/uploads/my_vs_code_e992bb155c.png)\n\n","introduction":"In this article, I would like to share with all of you guys my favourite VSC and terminal configuration. Because I rather prefer a very esthetic design and my daily use apps have to be good-looking - so only if I can prettify ugly app I definitely do!","publicationDate":"2021-03-06T11:09:56.815Z","strapiID":2,"image":"/static/ea1b48841f1565cff7d91a1681fde705/308770105d446630e285cb9f87873c3d.jpg"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
