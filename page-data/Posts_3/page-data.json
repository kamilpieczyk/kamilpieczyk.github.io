To be honest how many developers there are across the world, that many ways to do so we can find, but the most important thing is - if you already started a project with one way - Do not change it, keep writing your code as you started. Never-ever change your project frames in the middle, because as a result, you'll have a mess that you tried to avoid.\n  In this post, I would like to show you my way to keep my projects in nice shape. As an example, I going to show you my standard react project structure using the gatsby.js framework, so let's do it!\n\n## Creating a new folder structure\n\nFirst of all - we need a new folder for our project. To create this I'll be using my console - it's more comfortable to do everything in one place. So let's create a new folder and then go toward it:\n![step_1.png](http://kamilpieczyk.tk:1337/uploads/step_1_ea161af62e.png)\n\nThen I use the command: gatsby new, to start a new gatsby project. If you don't have gatsby CLI installed globally to do this use the command\n\n```npm install -g gatsby-cli```\n\nand then answer a few questions that gatsby ask you. I've installed styled-components during this process.\n![step_2.png](http://kamilpieczyk.tk:1337/uploads/step_2_36c863fddf.png)\n\nOnce when gatsby-CLI finished its work let's go into our new project using cd <our new name>, in my case cd example.\nNext hit the command ``` npm run develop``` and after a few seconds, your new project will be ready on port 8000.\n\n![step_3.png](http://kamilpieczyk.tk:1337/uploads/step_3_9a597f9072.png)\n\nSo let's have a look at our folder structure. In this article, the most important folder is src - where we will keep our components and pages. As you noticed folder pages already exist, so let's create another one called components:\n\n![step_4.png](http://kamilpieczyk.tk:1337/uploads/step_4_1aa10e2678.png)\n\n## Frames for our new project\n\nIn this paragraph, I would like to finally show my way how I keep my projects in the right order. To introduce my way I'll create with you a whole component ready to use later.\nFirst step: create a new folder for our new component inside the components folder. In this case, I'll call it a header.\n\n![step_5.png](http://kamilpieczyk.tk:1337/uploads/step_5_ce4f4feca0.png)\n\n2nd step, I create a few new files: index.tsx, header.view.tsx and header.styles.tsx\n![step_6.png](http://kamilpieczyk.tk:1337/uploads/step_6_7a872d7ccb.png)\n\nInside of my index file, I'll keep my components logic layer, inside of the header.view.tsx I keep my presentation layer - so simply said my view, and inside my header.styles.tsx I'll keep my styles using styled-components.\nPermit to see my styles file, where I create my Container div.\n\n![step_7.png](http://kamilpieczyk.tk:1337/uploads/step_7_c652247b93.png)\n![step_9.png](http://kamilpieczyk.tk:1337/uploads/step_9_26960934b5.png)\n![step_8.png](http://kamilpieczyk.tk:1337/uploads/step_8_35dce8a4cf.png)\n\n","introduction":"Always when you start a new project need to choose a few standards for the new app. One of them is the way how you hold your new project in frames. If the project is kept in disorder and chaos your code mates and most probably yourself may have many problems in the future to control what is what.","publicationDate":"2021-03-11T12:01:01.070Z","strapiID":3,"image":"/static/1b48818bd7e182549d6e98c20062339f/6bff8307699e9c07b890450e4f8d619e.jpg"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
